# skim_delphes

Macro skim_Delphes.C reads any Delphes (.root) file, looks into Delphes Ttree, and saves TLorentzVectors for jets, b-tagged jets, electrons, muons, photons into a smaller file skimmed_delphes.root.

Macro read_skimmed_delphes.C reads the file skimmed_delphes.root and prints all the TLorentzVectors for all events.
